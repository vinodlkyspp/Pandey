# Pathshala-Help kids to stay in school
 <br/>
 <br/>
**What is Pathshala**: Its an socio-technological solution to reduce dropout rates in poor schools in **India**. Its primarily a mobile application targeting middle class smart phone users to buy and donate school supplies (materials) for the poor schools where dropout is high. Schools supplies could include *a) teaching material b) furnitures for schools c) stationary d) equipments for schools including computer e) Health kits ( including sanitary pads and soaps) and any other listed item by the listed school*.
<br/>
<br/>
**How Pathshala works ( For school)**: Schools need to register on the Pathshala application by uploading three key documents: a) Bank statements b) Registration documents c) Address proof. Each school listed on the Pathshala app would be verified on it’s a) operation , b) legal identity  c) number of children attending or possibility to attend school and d) the need. Preference would be given to Primary schools ( up to 5th class) , then middle schools ( up to 8th class)  and then Higher Secondary schools ( 10-12th class) . On average schools cannot put more than USD 1000 (approx. value) value items on app in a month). Idea of *Pathshala* is to support the schools in very poor condition and struggling with basic support. 
<br/>
<br/>
**How Pathshala works ( For donor)**:On the other hand it also gives space to community in general to come forward and support the need of the school listed on the Pathshala app by:a) Browsing the app and based on the need buy the required item by school and sending to the address code of the school listed by buying the required listed items through Pathshala app online shopping partners ( which would also include local suppliers).b) Donors can only send the items and no money. This is to zero down any misuse of money and other financial related obligations. D c) There will be no tax benefits for the supporters, it would be volunteer support d) In terms of some human resource requirement –donors could offer support as volunteers for teaching or other human resource requirements.**Incentives for donors would be:** a)•	It’s a good feeling. It creates smile.Its lifestyle. b)Each donor would receive a certificate from the school signed by some students and teachers. The certificate would also be designed by school. It could be a simple painting. The designed certificate would send by school to Sustainable Pathshala team and the team would frame it , pack it nicely and send it to the donor c)It’s not just about supporting school; it’s about sustaining schools in India and making more children to attain school.

<br/>
**What would be the impact of Pathshala in next 5 years:** In next five years Pathshala look forward to reduce the drop-out rates from 50% to 5% in about 1000 schools registered on the Pathshala application through the support from 50000 donors from India and different parts of the world. 
<br/>
<br/>
**What Makes Pathshala important and different**:  Its material support to poor schools ( so any one from any part of the world could donate on this application) and this also reduces the chances of corruption.
